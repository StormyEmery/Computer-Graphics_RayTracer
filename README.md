# Computer-Graphics_RayTracer
Final Project for the Computer Graphics course at the University of Texas. It generates ray-traced images of complex scenes using the Whitted illumination model.

Implemented triagnle-ray intersection so that the ray tracer could display triangle meshes.
Implemented the Whitted illumination model, which includes Phong shading as well as reflection and refraction. Handles both directional and point lights.
Implemented Phong interpolation of normals on triangle meshes.
Implemented anti-aliasing using super-sampling.
Implemented cube mapping.
Implemented texture mapping.
